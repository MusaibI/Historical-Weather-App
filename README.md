# Weather Data Visualization

This is a React app that allows users to input weather data (latitude, longitude, start date, end date) and visualize the results through interactive charts and a paginated table. The weather data is displayed using line charts, making it easier to track trends over time.

## Features
- **Weather Data Input**: Users can enter the latitude, longitude, start date, and end date to fetch weather data.
- **Interactive Chart**: Displays weather trends, such as temperature, in a dynamic line chart.
- **Paginated Table**: Shows weather data in a paginated table for easy navigation and review.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering interactive line charts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Form Handling**: Forms are used to capture user input and fetch weather data.
